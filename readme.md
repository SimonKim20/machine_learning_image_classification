# Machine Learning - Neural Networks: Image Classification
___
As the need for smarter and efficient technologies continues to increase, [***machine learning***](https://www.sas.com/en_au/insights/analytics/machine-learning.html) constantly steps up as one of the strongest, most viable solutions. With the aid of [***neural networks***](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/neural-network-introduction/), this projects shows the capabilities of machine learning systems to 'learn' how to solve complex problems, previously only possible by humans, through the simple example of an image classifier.

Image classification is a surprisingly complex and difficult process which even humans need to be trained to master. Humans need to be exposed to an image/object to be able to recognise and classify it confidently, some to a higher degree than others (this process can be easily observed when babies/young children need to take time to learn what certain things are since their brains haven't developed enough to make this process extremely quick). Courtesy of the [***Cifar-10***](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset, this project utilises machine learning to train a neural network to: classify certain images; recognise patterns and correlations in data; and over time continuously learn and improve, much like a human brain.

The task of 'teaching' a program to be able to classify images of objects by class can seem daunting. However, with the aid of machine learning, this task is very achievable.
